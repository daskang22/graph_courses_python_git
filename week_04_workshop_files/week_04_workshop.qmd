# India TB Pathways Dataset 

The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It
examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis
patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).

Please see below the first 5 rows of the dataset

```{python}
# Read the CSV file
india_tb_data = pd.read_csv("/Users/adask/Documents/graph_courses_workspace/data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")

# View the data
from itables import show


show(india_tb_data.head())
```

# Visualisation 


We have an unbalanced dataset with the majority of the patients being male

```{python}
fig1 = px.histogram(india_tb_data, title="No of patients per Sex", x='Sex', text_auto= True)

fig1
```


We see that overall the female population is of younger age compared to the male. The median of males is at 50y while for women is at 40y.



```{python}
fig2 = px.violin(india_tb_data,title="Age distribution per Sex", y="Age", x="Sex", box=True, color="Sex")

fig2
```


Looking into the TB results from the initial smear test, we do not see a big difference between sexes. Men have slightly higher % of positive cases. We chose the % since our dataset is imbalanced.




```{python}
fig3 = px.histogram(
    india_tb_data,
    title="% of TB result per sex group",
    x="Sex",
    color="Form of TB", 
    barnorm="percent",
    text_auto=".1f")

fig3
```




# Some info


```{python}
max_age = int(india_tb_data.Age.max())
min_age  = int(india_tb_data.Age.min())

```


The oldest patient is `{python} max_age` years old, while the youngest is `{python} min_age` years old
